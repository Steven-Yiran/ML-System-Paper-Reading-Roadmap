# Machine Learning and Software Systems Papers Reading Roadmap

Here is a guide to learn about the lastest trends in the intersection of software systems and Artifical Intelligence.
In the process of developing deep learning systems, I realized the importance of the underlying systems that supported AI applications.
These new hardware and software systems includes TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache Spark, Ray not to mention the systems deployed internally at companies.
This repo is a guide to learning about this dynamic, interdisplinary area of research.

This repo is inspired by Joseph E. Gonzalez's Machine Learning Systems course [[link]](https://ucbrise.github.io/cs294-ai-sys-fa19/)
